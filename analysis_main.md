 This document provides a detailed comparison of the Python and Go implementations of a memory system for AI agents. The analysis focuses on core functionality, data      
 structures, error handling, logging, and code structure.                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                           
 ## 1. Core Functionality                                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                           
 ### Initialization (`__init__` vs. `NewMemory`)                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                           
 *   **Python (`__init__`):** Initializes the `Memory` class by creating instances of `EmbedderFactory`, `VectorStoreFactory`, `LlmFactory`, and `SQLiteManager` based on  
 the provided `MemoryConfig`. It also sets the `collection_name` and captures an initialization event using `capture_event`.                                               
 *   **Go (`NewMemory`):** The Go code does the same, creating instances of `EmbedderFactory`, `VectorStoreFactory`, `LlmFactory`, and `sqlitemanager.SQLiteManager`. It   
 also initializes telemetry and sets the `collectionName`. The logic is very similar, but the Go code uses `log.Fatalf` for errors during initialization, which will       
 terminate the program.                                                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                           
 ### Adding Memories (`add` vs. `Add`)                                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                           
 *   **Python (`add`):** Embeds the input `data`, extracts memories using the LLM, searches for existing memories, and then uses the LLM with tools to decide whether to   
 add, update, or delete memories. It uses `get_update_memory_messages` to prepare the messages for the LLM. It iterates through the tool calls and executes the            
 corresponding functions.                                                                                                                                                  
 *   **Go (`Add`):** The Go code follows a similar process. It embeds the data, extracts memories using the LLM, searches for existing memories, and then uses the LLM wit 
 tools to decide whether to add, update, or delete memories. It also uses `getUpdateMemoryMessages` (which you'll need to provide) to prepare the messages for the LLM. It 
 iterates through the tool calls and executes the corresponding functions.                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                           
 ### Retrieving Memories (`get`, `get_all`, `search` vs. `Get`, `GetAll`, `Search`)                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                           
 *   **Python (`get`, `get_all`, `search`):** Retrieves memories by ID, lists all memories with filters, and searches for memories using a query. It uses the `vector_stor 
 to interact with the underlying vector database. It also filters the results and returns them as a list of dictionaries.                                                  
 *   **Go (`Get`, `GetAll`, `Search`):** The Go code does the same, using the `vectorStore` to interact with the vector database. It also filters the results and returns  
 them as a list of maps.                                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                           
 ### Updating Memories (`update` vs. `Update`)                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                           
 *   **Python (`update`):** Updates a memory by ID by calling the `_update_memory_tool` function.                                                                          
 *   **Go (`Update`):** The Go code does the same, calling the `updateMemoryTool` function.

 *   **Python:** Uses Python's built-in data structures like `dict`, `list`, and `str`. It also uses Pydantic for data validation and type hinting.                        
 *   **Go:** Uses Go's built-in data structures like `map[string]interface{}`, `[]map[string]interface{}`, and `string`. It uses structs to represent data structures like 
 `SearchResult` and `Memory`.                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                           
 ## 3. Error Handling                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                           
 *   **Python:** Uses exceptions for error handling.                                                                                                                       
 *   **Go:** Uses error returns for error handling.                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                           
 ## 4. Logging and Telemetry                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                           
 *   **Python:** Uses the `logging` module and a custom `capture_event` function.                                                                                          
 *   **Go:** Uses the `log` package and a custom `telemetry` package.                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                           
 ## 5. Asynchronous Operations                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                           
 *   Neither the Python nor the Go code appears to use asynchronous operations.                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                           
 ## 6. Code Structure and Style                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                           
 *   **Python:** Uses classes and methods to organize the code.                                                                                                            
 *   **Go:** Uses structs and functions to organize the code.                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                           
 ## Key Differences and Issues                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                           
 1.  **`getUpdateMemoryMessages`:** The Go code relies on a `getUpdateMemoryMessages` function, which is not present in the provided code. You'll need to implement this   
 function in Go to match the Python functionality.                                                                                                                         
 2.  **`updateMemoryToolWrapper`:** The Go code has an `updateMemoryToolWrapper` function that seems redundant. It can be removed and the logic moved to the               
 `updateMemoryTool` function.                                                                                                                                              
 3.  **Error Handling:** The Go code uses `log.Fatalf` in `NewMemory`, which will terminate the program on initialization errors. It might be better to return errors to   
 allow the caller to handle them.                                                                                                                                          
 4.  **Data Validation:** The Python code uses Pydantic for data validation, which is not present in the Go code. You might want to add data validation to the Go code to  
 ensure that the input data is in the correct format.                                                                                                                      
 5.  **Timezones:** The Python code uses `pytz` to handle timezones, while the Go code uses `time.LoadLocation`. Make sure the timezone handling is consistent.            
 6.  **String Conversion:** The Python code uses f-strings for string formatting, while the Go code uses `fmt.Sprintf`.                                                    
 7.  **Metadata Handling:** The Python code uses `model_dump` to serialize the `MemoryItem` objects, while the Go code uses manual map creation.                           
 8.  **Tool Call Arguments:** The Python code directly passes the `tool_call["arguments"]` to the function, while the Go code unmarshals the arguments from a JSON string. 
                                                                                                                                                                           
 ## Next Steps                                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                           
 1.  **Implement `getUpdateMemoryMessages` in Go:** This is crucial for the `Add` function to work correctly.                                                              
 2.  **Remove `updateMemoryToolWrapper`:** Move the logic to `updateMemoryTool`.                                                                                           
 3.  **Review Error Handling:** Decide whether to use `log.Fatalf` or return errors in `NewMemory`.                                                                        
 4.  **Add Data Validation:** Consider adding data validation to the Go code.                                                                                              
 5.  **Ensure Consistent Timezone Handling:** Make sure the timezone handling is consistent between Python and Go.                                                         
 6.  **Review Metadata Handling:** Ensure that the metadata is handled correctly in both languages.                                                                        
 7.  **Test Thoroughly:** Add unit and integration tests to ensure that the Go code behaves the same as the Python code.
