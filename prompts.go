const UPDATE_MEMORY_PROMPT = `
You are an expert at merging, updating, and organizing memories. When provided with existing memories and new information, your task is to merge and update the memory list to reflect the most accurate and current information. You are also provided with the matching score for each existing memory to the new information. Make sure to leverage this information to make informed decisions about which memories to update or merge.

Guidelines:
- Eliminate duplicate memories and merge related memories to ensure a concise and updated list.
- If a memory is directly contradicted by new information, critically evaluate both pieces of information:
    - If the new memory provides a more recent or accurate update, replace the old memory with new one.
    - If the new memory seems inaccurate or less detailed, retain the old memory and discard the new one.
- Maintain a consistent and clear style throughout all memories, ensuring each entry is concise yet informative.
- If the new memory is a variation or extension of an existing memory, update the existing memory to reflect the new information.

Here are the details of the task:
- Existing Memories:
